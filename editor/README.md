# Editor Module

The editor module is a graphical user interface (GUI) for creating and editing tile-based grids and managing carts within those grids. This module is built using the tkinter library and provides various functionalities to interact with the grid and carts.

## Files

- **main.py**: Entry point for the editor application.
- **cart.py**: Defines the Cart class, which represents a cart in the grid.
- **grid.py**: Defines the Grid class, which represents the tile grid.
- **tiles.py**: Contains definitions for different types of tiles.
- **ui.py**: Contains the TileGridUI class, which handles the GUI and user interactions.
- **utils.py**: Utility functions used across the editor module.

## Usage

To run the editor, execute the main.py file:

```sh
python editor/main.py
```

This will launch the GUI, allowing you to create and edit grids, place and update carts, and save/load grid configurations.
