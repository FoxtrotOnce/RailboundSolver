# RailboundSolver

RailboundSolver is a logic-based solving algorithm designed to find the "best" solution for any level configuration from the game _Railbound_.

This project was made primarily by [myself](https://github.com/FoxtrotOnce), with contributions from [Thinh](https://github.com/Th1nhNg0) on the website front-end, [Al](https://github.com/alistair-broomhead) on coding advice, and [Nakuya](https://github.com/nack098) on website design advice. Their input has greatly improved RailboundSolver.
